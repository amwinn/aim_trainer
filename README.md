The objective of this game is to prevent all four balls from being shrunk at the same time.
Balls are shrunk from colliding with the canvas edges, as well as from the roaming bar.
Balls are restored to full size by clicking on them with the mouse, which yields 1 point.
The win condition is met once 50 points have been accrued.
