The objective of this game is to prevent all four circles from being in a reduced state at the same time.
Circles are reduced through collision with the canvas edges, as well as from the roaming bar.
Circles are restored to full size by clicking on them with the mouse, which yields 1 point.
The win condition is met once 50 points have been accrued.
